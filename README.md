## CS-305 8-1 Journal Portfolio

#### Artemis Financial is a company that creates personalized financial plans for its clients, needed to improve the security of their software, particularly in managing sensitive data. My role was to identify and fix any security issues and recommend the best encryption methods to protect their long-term stored files.

#### I carefully addressed security vulnerabilities in their software and suggested strong encryption methods to protect their data. Secure coding is crucial because it prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive information. By improving their softwareâ€™s security, the company made sure data was protected and complied with legal requirements.

#### The most challenging aspect was maintaining software speed and efficiency while adding security measures, especially with large data volumes. However, this challenge was beneficial as it improved my understanding of secure coding and the selection of appropriate encryption techniques which improved my ability to balance security with performance.

#### To enhance security, I recommended using AES-256 encryption and good key management practices. In the future, I would use a combination of automated tools and manual reviews to detect vulnerabilities. These tools, along with security testing, would help in identifying weaknesses and determining the best mitigation strategies.

#### To ensure the software remained functional and secure, I performed comprehensive testing after making code changes. This process involved verifying that everything operated correctly and that no new security issues were introduced.

#### I utilized several key resources and tools that will be valuable in future work, such as secure coding guidelines and encryption libraries. These resources made sure that the software's security and will be useful for future projects.

#### For future employers, I would showed my detailed security assessment, the encryption strategies I recommended, and the secure coding practices I implemented. These examples show my ability to identify security risks, develop effective solutions, and made sure that the software is both secure and functional.
